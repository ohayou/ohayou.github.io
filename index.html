			<p>Hong Kong Dim Sim Kitchen was founded by Ho Kok Ching in 1982 as a small store on Sussex Street, Chinatown. Having worked with Dim Sim "Sifu"s since the age of 14, he immigrated to Australia with the goal to bring the original flavours of Yum Cha Finger food to the Australian public. 



Through the word-of-mouth of satisfied customers, and our commitment to maintaining the integrity of our products, we have gradually expanded the reach of our three operating arms; Retail, Wholesale and Catering. 



Our production facility is HACCP accredited and we use only 100% Australian meat, poultry and produce. From the making of the dough, to the kneading of pastry, dicing and preparation of ingredients and finally the packaging for delivery, we take great care and pleasure in each stage of the production process to ensure that each experience with our products is a memorable one.  </p>

			<h2>Our Difference</h2>

<h3>Recipe</h3>

<p>All our recipes come from the hands of Mr Ho Kok Ching, and his lifetime of eating and making his own "Dim Sum". True "Dim Sum' chefs are a dying breed. Call it old-fashioned, but for much of our 30 years of operation, we focused purely on making the best Dim Sims, Steamed Buns and Dumplings that we could everyday, and believed that our products would sell themselves. In a business where every bite counts, we continue to be meticulous about the little things, like making our bun dough fresh every morning using the same recipe, and recognising that food texture is just as, if not more important than appearance and taste. Having said this, we realise that a recipe is never perfect, and with the ever-changing needs of the Australian public, we welcome all kinds of feedback, good or bad, and are open to changes if it will better serve the customer.</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>We make our products to be restaurant quality at the minimum, but price them so they can be enjoyed by anyone at anytime.</p>



<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>An authentic recipe is nothing without the right ingredients. The BBQ Pork used for our BBQ Pork Bun, comes as raw pork shoulder, which we slice, roast, marinade and dice ourselves, using our own custom-built furnace. We will never use any meat in any of our products that you wouldn't use for yourself at home.</p>



<h3>Service</h3>

<p>Complacency and inefficiency have never been and will never used to describe our company. Our foundation was built supplying the takeaway shops, mum 'n' dad restaurants and suburban haunts, with our most loyal customers having been with us for over 10 years. The late night phone calls for next-day orders, after-work deliveries, and custom orders are what made Hong Kong Dim Sim Kitchen into what it is today and is part of our DNA. If it can be done, it will be done.</p>
